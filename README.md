The **Fetch User Data Web App** is a responsive and user-friendly application that retrieves and displays user information from the JSONPlaceholder API. It dynamically loads user data, presents it in stylish cards, supports reload functionality, and gracefully handles network or request failures. This project demonstrates practical API consumption, DOM manipulation, and responsive UI implementation using modern JavaScript.
